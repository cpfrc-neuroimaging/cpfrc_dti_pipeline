# DTI Pipeline Documentation- University of Michigan CPFRC

This documentation aims to serve as a guide for using the CPFRC DTI pipeline. The steps include everything from starting with the raw data from the fMRI Lab to creating a connectome for invidual subjects. Our pipeline draws heavily from the tutorial by Andy Jahn which can be found here: https://andysbrainbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/MRtrix/MRtrix_Course/MRtrix_00_Diffusion_Overview.html. It has been modified for our computing environment and largely transposed into Python. That being said, most of what's found here is broadly applicable beyond the CPFRC environment.
